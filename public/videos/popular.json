        "description": "This Summer, meet the residents of Element City\n\nWatch the new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s #Elemental and see the movie in 3D, only in theaters June 16!\n\nCheck out a brand-new trailer for Disney and Pixar’s “Elemental,” an all-new original feature film that transports moviegoers to an extraordinary place called Element City, where a host of elements live and work. The trailer showcases each element—air, earth, water and fire—and what sets them apart according to Ember, a quick-witted and fiery woman who’s always stayed close to home in Firetown. In “Elemental,” which opens in theaters on June 16, she finally ventures out of her comfort zone to explore this spectacular world born from the imaginations of Pixar’s filmmakers and specifically crafted for the big-screen experience. Element City is inspired by big cities around the globe and embraces theorized contributions from each elemental community—from giant pine-tree-like buildings and waterfall skyscrapers to a tornado-shaped arena called Cyclone Stadium. \n\nJoining the previously announced voice cast including Leah Lewis and Mamoudou Athie as Ember and Wade, respectively, are Ronnie del Carmen as Ember’s soon-to-be retired dad, Bernie; Shila Ommi as Ember’s love-seeking mom, Cinder; Wendi McLendon-Covey as Wade’s stormy and Air-Ball-loving boss, Gale; Catherine O’Hara as Wade’s welcoming mom, Brook; Mason Wertheimer as Ember’s admiring earth neighbor, Clod; and Joe Pera as an overgrown city bureaucrat, Fern.\n \nDirected by Peter Sohn, produced by Denise Ream, p.g.a., and executive produced by Pete Docter, “Elemental” features a screenplay by John Hoberg & Kat Likkel and Brenda Hsueh with story by Sohn, Hoberg & Likkel and Hsueh. The film’s original score was composed and conducted by Thomas Newman. \n\r\nPixar Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/pixar/\r\nPixar Twitter: https://twitter.com/pixar\r\nPixar Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pixar\r\n \r\nCopyright: (C) Disney•Pixar",

        "description": "Trolls Band Together - In Theaters this Fall\n\nThis holiday season, get ready for an action-packed, all-star, rainbow-colored family reunion like no other as Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake return for the new chapter in DreamWorks Animation’s blockbuster musical franchise: Trolls Band Together. \n\nAfter two films of true friendship and relentless flirting, Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) are now officially, finally, a couple (#broppy)! As they grow closer, Poppy discovers that Branch has a secret past. He was once part of her favorite boyband phenomenon, BroZone, with his four brothers: Floyd (Golden Globe nominated electropop sensation Troye Sivan), John Dory (Eric André; Sing 2), Spruce (Grammy winner Daveed Diggs; Hamilton) and Clay (Grammy winner Kid Cudi; Don’t Look Up).

        "description": "Watch the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor celebrating Adam Sandler on CNN.com or CNNgo.\n\nhttps://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nThe Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s greatest humorists, was awarded to Adam Sandler at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy -- including Chris Rock, Conan O'Brien, Ben Stiller, Dana Carvey, Pete Davidson, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Anniston, Idina Menzel, David Spade, and more -- on March 19, 2023, and aired nationally on CNN on March 26, 2023.\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\n“Adam Sandler has entertained audiences for over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,” said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year’s recipient. “Adam has created characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to bring together the best in comedy.”\n\n#MarkTwainPrize #AdamSandler #kennedycenter #cnn \n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb",

          "description": "Watch the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor celebrating Adam Sandler on CNN.com or CNNgo.\n\nhttps://www.kennedy-center.org/whats-on/marktwain/\n\nThe Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize, which is named to honor one of the world’s greatest humorists, was awarded to Adam Sandler at a gala performance featuring some of the biggest names in comedy -- including Chris Rock, Conan O'Brien, Ben Stiller, Dana Carvey, Pete Davidson, Drew Barrymore, Jennifer Anniston, Idina Menzel, David Spade, and more -- on March 19, 2023, and aired nationally on CNN on March 26, 2023.\n\nThe Mark Twain Prize for American Humor recognizes individuals who have had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th-century novelist and essayist Samuel Clemens, best known as Mark Twain. As a social commentator, satirist, and creator of characters, Clemens was a fearless observer of society, who startled many while delighting and informing many more with his uncompromising perspective on social injustice and personal folly.\n\n“Adam Sandler has entertained audiences for over three decades with his films, music, and his tenure as a fan favorite cast member on SNL,” said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter about this year’s recipient. “Adam has created characters that have made us laugh, cry, and cry from laughing. I am looking forward to a laughter-filled evening like no other as we celebrate his career at a ceremony that is sure to bring together the best in comedy.”\n\n#MarkTwainPrize #AdamSandler #kennedycenter #cnn \n\nSubscribe to The Kennedy Center! http://bit.ly/2gNFrtb"
